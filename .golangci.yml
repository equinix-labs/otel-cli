issues:
  exclude:
    # Default excludes from `golangci-lint run --help` with EXC0002 removed
    # EXC0001 errcheck: Almost all programs ignore errors on these functions and in most cases it's ok
    - Error return value of .((os\.)?std(out|err)\..*|.*Close|.*Flush|os\.Remove(All)?|.*print(f|ln)?|os\.(Un)?Setenv). is not checked
    # EXC0002 golint: Annoying issue about not having a comment. The rare codebase has such comments
    # - (comment on exported (method|function|type|const)|should have( a package)? comment|comment should be of the form)
    # EXC0003 golint: False positive when tests are defined in package 'test'
    - func name will be used as test\.Test.* by other packages, and that stutters; consider calling this
    # EXC0004 govet: Common false positives
    - (possible misuse of unsafe.Pointer|should have signature)
    # EXC0005 staticcheck: Developers tend to write in C-style with an explicit 'break' in a 'switch', so it's ok to ignore
    - ineffective break statement. Did you mean to break out of the outer loop
    # EXC0006 gosec: Too many false-positives on 'unsafe' usage
    - Use of unsafe calls should be audited
    # EXC0007 gosec: Too many false-positives for parametrized shell calls
    - Subprocess launch(ed with variable|ing should be audited)
    # EXC0008 gosec: Duplicated errcheck checks
    - (G104|G307)
    # EXC0009 gosec: Too many issues in popular repos
    - (Expect directory permissions to be 0750 or less|Expect file permissions to be 0600 or less)
    # EXC0010 gosec: False positive is triggered by 'src, err := ioutil.ReadFile(filename)'
    - Potential file inclusion via variable
