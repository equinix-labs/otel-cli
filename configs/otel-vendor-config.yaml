# opentelemetry-collector is a proxy for telemetry events.
#
# This configuration is set up for use in otel-cli development.
# With collector in debug mode every trace is printed to the console
# which makes working on otel-cli quick & easy. There are also
# examples below for how to send to Lightstep and Honeycomb.
